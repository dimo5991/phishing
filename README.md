## About the tool :
It is a tool for making fake pages
For some sites to help you catch
Page information from e-mail and password
But you must use social engineering to catch your prey
The tool is 50% on you and 50% on you to hack
It is just a tool that does what it was designed for
And you have to do what you have to
Thank you and good luck my friends
